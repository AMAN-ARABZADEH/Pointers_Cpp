# Pointers
Examples and explanations of using pointers in C++ for Beginners.
This code provides examples and explanations of using pointers in C++.
Pointers are variables that store memory addresses of other variables, allowing indirect access and manipulation of data stored in memory.

## What is a pointer?

A pointer in C++ is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. 
It enables us to indirectly access and manipulate data by accessing the value stored at a specific memory location.

## Why use pointers in C++?

Pointers are used in C++ for various reasons:
1. Dynamic memory allocation: Pointers enable the allocation and deallocation of memory during runtime using operators like `new` and `delete`.
  This flexibility is essential for managing memory dynamically.
3. Efficiency: Pointers can be more efficient in certain scenarios, such as when dealing with large data structures or when passing arguments to functions.
   Rather than passing entire data, we can pass the memory address.
5. Direct memory access: Pointers provide direct access to memory, allowing us to modify data at a particular memory location.
   This can be beneficial for low-level programming or optimizing performance in embedded systems.

## Potential pitfalls with pointers

Using pointers requires caution to avoid potential pitfalls:
1. Null pointers: Pointers that are not initialized or assigned a valid memory address can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
   It is crucial to initialize pointers to `nullptr` or valid memory addresses.
3. Dangling pointers: Pointers that point to memory that has been deallocated can result in accessing invalid data.
   Avoid using dangling pointers by deallocating memory when it's no longer needed.
5. Memory leaks: Forgetting to deallocate dynamically allocated memory with `delete` or `delete[]` can lead to memory leaks.
   Memory leaks occur when allocated memory is not freed, causing the program to consume more memory over time.
   Proper memory deallocation is essential to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient memory usage.
